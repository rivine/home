## Getting started

Even though Rivine is a toolkit for creating custom chains, it has it's own testnet running publicly.

The released binaries automatically connect to this public chain: 

- **Desktop**: Desktop reference wallet available at https://github.com/rivine/rivine-UI/releases
- **Server**: Rivine daemon and command line client available at https://github.com/rivine/rivine/releases

Contact the rivine maintainers with a small motivation to acquire coins and/or blockstakes.

The blockchain explorer is available at https://explorer.rivine.io
