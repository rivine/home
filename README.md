## Getting started

Even though Rivine is a toolkit for creating chain, it has it's own testnet running publicly.

The released binaries automatically connect to this public chain: 

- **Desktop**: Desktop reference wallet available at https://github.com/rivine/rivine-UI/releases
- **Server**: rivine daemon and command line client available at https://github.com/rivine/rivine/releases

Contact the rivine maintainers to acquire coins and/or blockstakes with a small motivation
